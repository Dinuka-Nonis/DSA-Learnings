/*
 * Insertion Sort Algorithm (using swapping):
 * ------------------------------------------
 * This algorithm builds the sorted part of the array one element at a time.
 * Starting from the second element, it repeatedly compares the current element
 * with the previous elements and swaps them leftward until it reaches the correct position.
 *
 * Think of it like sorting playing cards in your hand:
 * each new card (element) is inserted into its proper place among the already sorted cards.
 *
 * After each outer loop iteration, the left part of the array (from index 0 to i)
 * becomes sorted.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Best Case (already sorted): O(n)
 * - Worst/Average Case: O(nÂ²)
 * - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)
